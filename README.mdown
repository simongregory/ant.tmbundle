TextMate Ant Bundle
===================

Provides TextMate support for [Apache Ant][apache_ant], the most recent version of Ant can be [downloaded here][ant_download]. Alternatively Ant can be found on the Apple Developer Tools Install Disk, but this version may be out of date.

Sg Branch
-----------------

The version of the bundle I use on a day to day basis whilst developing.

'master' differences:

 * Template command creates a .xml file rather than ant.xml file.
 * Relevant scopes are changed to include ActionScript 3 and MXML.

Installation
------------

Via download:

 * Open this [link][ant_bundle_zip]  
 * Unzip the download  
 * Rename the folder to Ant.tmbundle  
 * Double-click  
 * TextMate handles the rest!  

To install via Git:

		cd ~/"Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/"
		git clone git://github.com/textmate/ant.tmbundle.git "Ant.tmbundle"
		osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

Optionally set the TM_ANT variable to point to your installation of Ant (ie /usr/local/bin/ant) in TextMate, preferences, advanced tab, shell variables.

Usage
-----

As Ant files are XML TextMate won't automatically distinguish them, to achieve this you can suffix your files with `ant.xml` or include `<!--ant-->` on the first line.  

Adding extra scopes to commands (Build and Build Target for example) Scope Selector field will allow access to them from files other than ant.xml.

### Autocomplete Tag (⌥⎋)

Takes the current word or selection and presents a matching list of known Ant tags. The full list was created using the documentation in version 1.7.0 of Ant.

### Build ( ⌘B)
Uses `TM_ANT_BUILD_FILE` if set, otherwise attempts to locate a build file and execute it. 

### Build Target ( ⌥⌘B)
Uses `TM_ANT_BUILD_FILE` if set, otherwise parses the current document for build targets from which you can select which one to execute.

### Run ( ⌘R)
Executes the current document.

### Validate Build File (⌃⇧V)
Validates the current document as valid XML. When the `TM_ANT_DTD_FILE` [environmental variable][tm_env_vars] has been set the document is also validated against the requested `ant.dtd`.

### Configuration Options

These environment variables allow you to define or customise the behaviour of certain commands. For help on setting them up please see [TextMate help][tm_env_vars]. 

* `TM_ANT` (default: `ant`)
The path to your ant executable.

* `TM_ANT_BUILD_FILE`
The location of the ant build file you wish to target by default. This can be either the full path, or relative to the current project.

* `TM_ANT_BUILD_PARSER`
This is Experimental - The location of a script to format the output of ant. Scripts are available to prettify the output for Java and Flex - in their respective bundles. If this variable is not set the output is wrapped in `pre` tags.

* `TM_ANT_DTD_FILE`
The location of a custom `ant.dtd` against which, in addition to verifying that the XML is well-formed, the _Validate Build File_ command can check the document conforms. It is possible to generate an `ant.dtd` by running a `<target>` with the following contents: `<antstructure output="ant.dtd" />`.

* `TM_ANT_MANUAL_PATH`
If you have installed your own version of Ant, you can set this variable to the location of its manual. For example if you installed it via MacPorts then set it to `/opt/local/share/java/apache-ant/docs/manual`. The default is to use the manual included with Apple’s developer tools with the [online version](http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html) as a fallback.
